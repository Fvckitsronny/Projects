</head>

<body>

<p>Hello! I'm Ronny Martinez. My current major of study is Electronics engineering.</p>
<p>I love to work with various computers and software and learn about them so i can apply what i learn from them to put in use in real life situations. I am a big enthusiast of cars, especially JDM cars. JDM stands for "Japenese Domestic Market" These consist of various Japense cars. For example a Honda, Nissan, Mitsubishi, etc. </p>
<p>I do not have any previous experience using Microsoft's Expression Web. And this is pretty much there is to know about me in a paragraph. :) </p>
